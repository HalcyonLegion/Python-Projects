#print((10+10)*3) - a basic calculation using math

#print("202" + 20) This does not work because "" denotes Text, not numbers(integers)

age=31

print("Hello my age is " + str(age))  #converts the variable from integer to a string

#print(max(-18,1, 0, 99, 20, 12)) this will print the Max(highest) value from a set of data, so will print(min)

print(round(pow(5,2)))  #round rounds the sum up, and pow is for square numbers, "to the power of" calcs etc

print(abs(-20)) #prints the "absolute" value, which is the positive value (converts minus to positive)

print(sqrt(25)) #prints the square root of a value

#ciel and floor functions return the greatest and smallest value for a number i.e. 23.9999 would be 24 with ciel and 23 with floor
#factorial function print(factorial(100)) what this is is 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8x9...etc all the way to 100
